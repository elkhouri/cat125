In response to "Coming and Going Web Design Trends for 2014" by Paula Borowska <a href="http://designmodo.com/web-design-trends-2014/">http://designmodo.com/web-design-trends-2014/</a>

First off, I agree with her only on some of her predictions regarding the web design trends of 2014. Take the first trend she observed, blurred backgrounds, for instance. Outside of that sample website Emotion of Sound she cherry-picked to demonstrate, I have yet seen another web site with the characteristically iOS 7 blurred background. While I’m sure there are other websites out there with blurred backgrounds, but based on personal experience, I would hardly call this a trend. Maybe a fad started by iOS 7, at most.

And to me, better user experience (UX) and more scrolling less clicking, both trends she observed, seem contradictory to me. I would go so far as to say replacing the traditional website layout of clicking links and buttons with a single page ever scrolling layout, though very interesting from a design perspective, is really a step backwards in user experience and goes entirely against the my principle of Keep It Simple. What is a user supposed to do after landing on the fancy scrolling page, such as the one she presented, Exposure? There are only two faint outlines of buttons with similar text, a puzzling description that may be about the website, and a small arrow off to the corner pointing down. Am I supposed to instinctively scroll down even when there’s no obvious cue telling me to? Or perhaps click the arrow? But clicking the arrow only scrolls down the page, and coincidently enough clicking the “Learn More” button does the exact same thing. Now those are three distinct actions all resulting in the same outcome—a recipe for confusion. It just isn’t clear how to use the website.

However, I agree with her other observations, namely the simple color and animation, as web designers leave the static, rainbow-colored designs of the past behind and embrace the new more interactive designs with  elements popping in and out while maintaining a coherent, simple color scheme.

<p>
In the end, maybe she is completely right and I’m the ignorant one. Only time will tell since a great majority of the websites still haven’t quite made it to the modern age yet.
