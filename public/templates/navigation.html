	<h2>Navigation</h2>
</div>
<p>
It’s a simple fact—people won’t use your website if they don’t know how to navigate in it. This shouldn’t come as a surprise since without knowing where you are and how to get anywhere, there’s no hope of ever finding whatever you’re looking for.
</p>
<p>
So how do we create a navigation system that Keeps It Simple?
</p>
<p>
First thing to notice is that web navigation actually shares many similarities with physical navigation, such as in a department store. Suppose you’re a guy looking for, let’s say, a pair of jeans. You would go inside the store and start looking for signs for the different  departments, like tools, appliances, men’s apparel, women’s apparel, etc. Once you find men’s apparel, possibly with the assistance of a helpful clerk, you would start looking for the section that has the jeans. And after you find them, you would look for the cash register to pay, then finally leave the store with jeans in hand.
</p>

</div>

<p>
In web navigation, you’re also looking for something, perhaps a particular news article or maybe even the same pair of jeans you were looking to buy in the department store. But instead of signs directing you where to go, there are tabs on top of the page listing different sections of the website and a search box in place of a clerk in case you have a question. After finding whatever you’re looking for, you would leave the website with newfound knowledge, or after paying if you’re buying something like in the department store.
</p>
<p>
But since the two mediums are so obviously different, you have to take into account problems that arise from those differences. Unlike physical navigation where you can simply look around the store to see how big it is and how much you’ve explored, there is no equivalent sense of scale in web navigation. There is no way of knowing how many pages there are without clicking all the links, which also happens to be one of your only source of information about the content you’ve already visited since the links change color after they’re clicked. As a result, it’s hard to judge whether you’ve seen all there is to see that is of interest to you, or there may be a link somewhere that leads to a treasure trove of information you haven’t discovered yet.
</p>
<p>
Another issue is that there is no sense of location in web navigation. Whereas in a store you can remember places by their physical location, such as “to the left of that aisle over there next to the ice creams”, there isn’t really a counterpart for that in web navigation when you all have are links and the back button of the browser to retrace your steps.

To keep us from getting lost due to these problems, a big part is having a global navigation always available which usually takes the form of the top or side bar that is almost always visible. It reassures users that they are still on the same website so they’re not really lost even if they may think they are, and the more or less static nature of the navigation across different pages of the same website means users only have to figure out how to navigate using it once instead of starting fresh on every page.
</p>
<p>
Now that we know we need a global navigation, what should be on it? The first and foremast thing is the website title which should be the most prominent element in the navigation, but not overly so as to distract from the main content. It should also be instantly recognizable so users will have no question which website they’re on.
</p>
<examples>
<p>
Then there are the main sections of the website such as the categories of products for a commerce website, sometimes accompanied by the subsections of the current section, followed by the utility sections that are not part of the main content but are nevertheless important such as signing in or registering. These are the digital analogues of the signs hanging in front of each aisle in a supermarket so the user knows where to look for what.
</p>
<examples>
<p>
And in the inevitable case when a user gets lost, it is crucial for the global navigation to have a link to the home page which provides an anchor where you can start the journey of clicking links and always have a familiar page to fall back to.
</p>
<Amazon example>
<p>
Last but not least, the global navigation should also have a search box that follows the standard convention of having either a magnifying glass icon or plain “Search” as a text label to allow for quick searching of the website which is sometimes more convenient than the potentially tiring process of finding and clicking the right links.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the global navigation, page titles are also a must in every page because reassuring users that they’re in the right website isn’t enough. Users like to be assured they’re in the right page of the website as well. And like the website title, the page title should also be prominent and by convention has the largest font size of the entire page but without the stylistic artwork website titles often employ.
</p>
<p>
And the same idea goes for the indicating the current section the user is in, usually by changing the background color and/or the text color of the current section in the global navigation.
The last tool in our navigation toolbelt is the breadcrumbs. They remedy the lack of location in web navigation by providing you with the hierarchical steps of how you arrived at the current page so you can more effectively retrace your steps.

Finally thanks to all the work we’ve done in a simple but useful navigation system, the user now has access to the key navigation information at a glance of an eye: the website title, the page title, the section, how he got there by breadcrumbs, and the place to find more information via the search box.
